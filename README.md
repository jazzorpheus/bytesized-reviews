#### Description:

Bytesized Book Reviews is a dynamic and responsive web application that allows users to sign up for an account, 'publish' their own book reviews under their username,
as well as read and comment on reviews published by other users. When publishing a review, there is a feature to add an image of the book
and give it a star rating out of 10. The number of characters that a user is allowed to use on their main review text is limited to 2000
in order to try and keep reviews succinct and to-the-point. This was one of the main ideas behind the project, hence the 'bytesized' in the title.
Users can also edit or delete a review they've authored at any time, and delete any comments they've made on their or others' review pages.

Some ideas for additional features include:

    * Make the formatting/styling more mobile-friendly, especially the homepage.

    * Have a confirmation email sent after registration.

    * Add a password reset capability (via user email).

    * Add user profile pages with some stats including number of reviews published, number of comments etc.

    * Add date-times to reviews and comments.

    * Add an edit feature to comments.

    * Implement infinite scrolling on index pages once the total number of displayed reviews exceeds a threshold.

    * Add a genre(s) category to reviews model and allow users to filter by genre.

    * Add a search bar feature to search for reviews matching keywords.
